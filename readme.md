This is an assignment from The Odin Project, read more [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

The goal of this assignment is to get comfortable using npm, webpack, and importing modules. It's also required that most of the DOM elements should be created with JavaScript using event listeners.

Since the prompt for the assignment was to create a simple restaurant website, I decided to have a little fun with it and pay homage to my favorite TV show.
